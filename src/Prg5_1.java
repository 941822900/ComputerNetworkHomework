/*
Prg5-1 flooding
 Write a program to simulate routing using flooding. Each packet should contain a counter that is
 decremented on each hop. When the counter gets to zero, the packet is discarded. Time is
 discrete, with each line handling one packet per time interval. Make three versions of the
 program: all lines are flooded, all lines except the input line are flooded, and only the
 (statically chosen) best k lines are flooded. Compare flooding with deterministic routing
 ( k = 1 ) in terms of both delay and the bandwidth used.
