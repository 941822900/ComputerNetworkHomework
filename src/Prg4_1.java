/*
Prg4-1 CSMA/CD
 Write a program to simulate the behavior of the CSMA/CD protocol over Ethernet when there are
 N stations ready to transmit while a frame is being transmitted. Your program should report the
 times when each station successfully starts sending its frame. Assume that a clock tick occurs
 once every slot time (51.2 usec) and a collision detection and sending of a jamming sequence
 takes one slot time. All frames are the maximum length allowed.
