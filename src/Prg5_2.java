/**
 * Prg5-2 Simulating a computer network using discrete time
 *  Write a program that simulates a computer network using discrete time. The first packet on each
 *  router queue makes one hop per time interval. Each router has only a finite number of buffers. If
 *  a packet arrives and there is no room for it, it is discarded and not retransmitted. Instead, there is
 *  an end-to-end protocol, complete with timeouts and acknowledgement packets, that eventually
 *  regenerates the packet from the source router. Plot the throughput of the network as a function
 *  of the end-to-end timeout interval, parameterized by error rate.
